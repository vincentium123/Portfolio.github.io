                                <h2>The Booker Prize</h2>
                                <p>Hello and welcome to my analysis of the Booker Prize! The Booker Prize is widely considered one of the top Englisg-language literary prizes in the world. Every years, around a dozen novels are selected by an eminient panel of writers, critics, and cultural figures as contendors for the prize. These dozen books (the longlist) are then reduced to six (the shortlist) before a winner is selected. The winning author is awarded a cash prize of 50,000 GBP. Originally reserved only for novels published by authors from the British Commonwealth, Ireland, or South Africa, it has since expanded to include all books originally published in English, regardless of the nationality of the author.</p>
                                <p>I was interested in answering a few questions about the Booker Prize, so I turned to Goodreads, the world’s largest book-focused social media platform. I assembled a list of all Booker Prize winners and nominees starting in 2001 and extending up to the present day- 345 novels in all. I then used Havan Agrawal’s excellent <a href="https://github.com/havanagrawal/GoodreadsScraper">GoodreadsScraper</a> tool to scrape data and did a bit of data cleaning using R. Once I had a clean dataset, I conducted analysis using PostgreSQL in pgAdmin 4.</p>
                                <p>The goal of this analysis was to look at two features of the novels nominated for the Booker Prize: their popularity and their quality. I wanted to know, among other things, if winners are rated more highly than nominees, what the most popular nominated novels are, and if, in contrast to stereotype, anyone actually reads most of the books on the longlist.</p>
                            
                                <p>In order not to have giant blocks of code interspersed with the text, I’ve put links to the SQL code I wrote for each section at the bottom of each section. I’ve also made the full dataset publicly available <a href="https://github.com/vincentium123/Awards">here</a> if you’re interested in it.</p>
                            
                                <p>Let’s get started.</p>
                                <div class="collapsible-section">
                                    <button class="collapsible-button">
                                        <span class="collapsible-text">1. Does anyone actually read Booker nominees?</span>
                                        <span class="collapsible-icon">+</span>
                                    </button>
                                    <div class="collapsible-content">
                                        <!-- Your collapsible section content goes here -->
                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;
                                        text-indent: 20px;">In 1981, John Banville, an Irish author who was nominated for the Booker, requested that he win the prize so that he could use the money to buy copies of all the novels on the longlist and send them to libraries, "thus ensuring that the books not only are bought but also read – surely a unique occurrence." There is a cliche that many of the books nominated for the Bookers are simply unpopular- out of line with public taste, overly literary and dull, and simply not bestseller material. I wanted to formally test that. I'm using if someone left a review as a proxy for if the book was read- although many people might leave a (negative) review if they stopped reading the book part-way through, most raters presumably read at least the majority of the novel.</p>

                                        text-indent: 20px;">The mean and the median tell very different stories here. We’d expect that there would be some books with extremely high numbers of ratings which would push the mean higher, while books with extremely low averages would have less effect. After all, there could be a book with potentially billions of reviews, while would result in an average in the millions, even if no one at all had read any of the other books. A smaller version of that seems to be what has happened. The mean Booker Prize nominated novel has nearly 50,000 ratings, while the median has only 7,500. The results are even starker if we just look at the novels on the longlist. The median novel there has only 3200 ratings, meaning that half of books have fewer. It seems that many Booker Prize longlisted novels are simply not widely read.

                                            </tr>
                                        </table>
                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;
                                        text-indent: 20px;">This is shown even more starkly if we look at the distribution of ratings. Overall, the 350 Booker Prize novels have received just over 17 million ratings. However, roughly half of those have gone to the top ten most popular books. If we expand to look at the top twenty, we find 62% of the ratings; the top 50, 81%. In other words, 15% of the books have 80% of the ratings. 
</p>
                                    
                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;
                                        text-indent: 20px;">We can see the opposite end of the scale by looking at the least popular novels. The bottom ten novels have only an average of 30 reviews each, the bottom 50, 240. Simply put, many Booker Prize nominees are not widely read. Several of them seem to be downright obscure. 
</p>                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;
                                        text-indent: 20px;">That raises the question: what are these popular novels that dominate the popularity contest? Looking at the list, several (Life of Pi, Room, Atonement) have been made into films. Others are classics of young adult literature (The Amber Spyglass, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time). Still others are from some of the most popular contemporary fiction authors like Kazuo Ishiguro and Sally Rooney.

                                        text-indent: 20px;">I’m interested in how closely the opinion of the Booker judges lines up with public opinion. If it does, we’d expect to see that the average rating given to winning novels exceeds the ratings for shortlisted novels which in turn exceed the ratings for longlisted novels. In fact, that is what we see. Novels on the longlist have an average rating of 3.60, which rises to 3.68 for shortlisted novels and 3.8 for winning novels.</p>

People rating winning novels might feel compelled to give higher ratings than they otherwise would, even if just to prove to themselves that they enjoyed the winner of a prestigious prize.

                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;text-indent: 20px;">In what percentage of years did the highest rated book by the public win the Booker? We can look at this a few different ways. Firstly, we can see what percentage of years that the highest rated book on the longlist- around a dozen books- ended up winning. We’d expect around 7%, just by chance, but the true answer is 13%, roughly double. That definitely indicates a connection between winning and popular acclaim. Looking at only the shortlist (6 books), however, gives less dramatic results. In that case, 22% of the most acclaimed novels won, where we’d expect 16%. This is not dramatically different. Practically, this seems to indicate that many of the worst books (in the opinion of the general public) do not make it to the shortlist, leaving only the best books to compete.

The most popular book won 26% of the time and the most popular book on the shortlist won 39% of the time. With the current data, however, it’s not possible to establish causation- many people read Booker Prize winners because they are Booker Prize winners, so that may explain the correlation.

Using the data from Goodreads, we should be able to establish which year had the best novels. However, the data offers a complication: more recent years are more highly rated than past years. The five highest rated years are the past five years; many of the lowest-rated years are among the earlier in the sample.

I uncovered this in my analysis of the Hugo Awards, where newer books are rated quite a bit higher than older ones. The other option is that there’s been a change to the Bookers that have let to more broadly-accessible books being nominated recently. This is entirely possible. One particular change that may have caused it is the change in 2014 to allow any novels published in English to be nominated for the prize, which opened the competition to, among others, American authors.

                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;text-indent: 20px;">Let’s state the obvious: a lot of people really don’t like Howard Jacobson. It seems the Booker judges disagree, however- The Finkler Question won the Booker Prize and J  was shortlisted. No other author appears more than once. However, there is a clear thread uniting all of them- their books are simply not very popular. The Finkler Question has by far the highest number of reviews. Several others have less than 100, putting them solidly in the bottom 5% of Booker nominees by rating. These seem to be the books that people are referring to when they wonder if people even read Booker nominees.

                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;text-indent: 20px;">I decided to look for Hidden Gems- books that have received relatively few ratings, but have overall good reviews. I defined these conditions as having reviews in the top 25% of books in the sample, but a number of reviews in the bottom 25%. There weren't many books that fit these criteria- only four. On the whole,they seem quite obscure, especially <i>Crossing the Lines by Melvyn Bragg</i>, with only 153 reviews. If you're looking for a book you've never even heard of before (and your friends have never heard of, either) any of these might be an excellent choice.</p>
