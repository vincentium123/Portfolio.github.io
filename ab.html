                                <p>As A/B testing if a key component of many modern websites and applications, I've prepared several examples that can be seen below. </p>

                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Hi, and welcome to an example A/B test I’ve put together. What I am presenting here is a bit different from a basic A/B test. Essentially, I have a <a href="https://github.com/liuchbryan/oce-dataset">dataset</a> which is composed of 48 real experiments, most with multiple variants, done on an e-commerce website (not by me). The dataset allows for practice on a key aspect of modern A/B tests- adaptive stopping. Adaptive stopping is when an experimenter ends an A/B test if certain conditions are met. This can save time and money, as well as expand the variety of options an A/B test covers. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">For example, let’s say a company is testing out 8 new advertisements. They also have an old advertisement as a control. Without adaptive stopping, the company might run all 8 advertisements for a certain time (let’s say a week) even if some of the advertising variants are not working. With adaptive stopping, a company can check on regular intervals if an advertisement is effective and end the variants early that are not in order to gather more data on those that are. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">This is what I have here. Each experiment contains one or more variants, as well as data about a control. I’ll be analyzing the effect of early stopping with an eye towards deciding on the optimal stopping conditions. All analysis was done using R. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Let’s begin. </p>
                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">First off, I’m using a simple t-test as a statistical model. While more advanced methods, such as Bayesian hypothesis tests would be a possible option, the t-test is sufficient for comparing two distributions. As the dataset gives me the means of the metrics for the control and treatment group, as well as the variance, I simulated a distribution of ten thousand data points for each before comparing.</p>
                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The original experiments checked on the progress of the A/B tests every 12 hours. There was no information about what triggered a stop to a particular test, but I chose two consecutive checks where there was no significant difference between the treatment and control groups. Additionally, there were 4 different metrics for success or failure: in this case, I chose to be conservative and count any experiment as failed if one of the metrics was not met.</p>
                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">As can be seen below, roughly 21.3% of the A/B tests failed based on these criteria. When they did, they failed after, on average 62.1 hours. This was highly clustered as well- failure was only recorded at 60 and 72 hours. Practically this means that the A/B tests would have needed roughly three days to deliver firm results. Ending them earlier would have less to a loss of valuable information. </p>
                                        <table style="width:30%; border-collapse: collapse; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                                            <tr>
                                                <td>Percent Failed
                                                </td>
                                                <td>21.3%</td>
                                            </tr>
                                            <tr>
                                                <td>Average Hour of Failure</td>
                                                <td>62.1</td>
                                            </tr>
                                        </table>
                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">However, the conditions used were not set in stone. If this had been an advertising campaign, for example, a company might want to remove expensive ads quickly if they were not performing as well as the benchmark. Doing it too often, however, would likely result in the loss of valuable information.</p>

                                            <tr>

                                                <td>37.3</td>
                                            </tr>
                                        </table>
                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">In this particular case, the difference in conditions causes dramatic changes. When the data is checked every 1, 3, or 6 hours, there is a failure rate of around 95%. This is not necessarily bad- if the aim is to quickly test out many options, this would be quite a good thing. Similarly, testing every 12 hours but ending after one failure also dramatically increased the failure rate to 97.9%. As before, this might be beneficial but could also simply be too sensitive.</p>

                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Hello there, and welcome to my example of an A/B test. This A/B test will be conducted with R, and is based on a publicly available dataset which can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faviovaz/marketing-ab-testing/data">here</a>. In this scenario, a company is attempting to see whether its recent ad campaign has been effective. It has conducted an experiment by placing ads on websites for some users while other users see PSAs unrelated to the company. These two groups are then compared to see whether they’ve bought the product the company is trying to sell or not. </p>
                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Before we get started, a few basic facts about the data:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>There are 588101 unique potential customers in the data set</li>
                                                <li>96% of potential customers saw the ads, 4% did not</li>
                                                <li>Approximately 97.5% of potential customers did not buy the product; only 2.5% did</li>
                                                <li>Customers were exposed to the ads multiple times (1-2065 times) with a median of 13.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </p>
                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">That said, let’s start the analysis!</p>
                                        <img src="images/marketing_ab1.png" style="max-width: 40%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 10px;">
                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">We’ll start with the basics, evaluating whether or not mere exposure to the ads is associated with buying the product. At a visual glance, it looks like it is. 2.55% of users who saw an ad bought the product, versus only 1.78% of users who saw the PSA. </p>
                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">However, there’s still a few tests to do. First thing: is this difference actually statistically significant? To find out, I’ll do a chi-squared test. We’re looking, ideally, for a value here of under 0.01, indicating that the difference between the two values is extremely unlikely if the event (buying the product) is equally likely for both PSA and ad-viewers. Luckily for us, we get a value of 2X10^-13, indicating that there’s a miniscule chance the ad campaign has had no effect of the likelihood of purchasing the product. </p>
                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">As a next step, we’ll look at the effect size: how much effect the ad campaign had on customer behavoir. For this, we’ll use Cramer’s V, a statistical test to determine effect size. Cramer’s V can return a value between 0 and 1, with 0 meaning no effect and 1 indicating an extremely strong effect. In this case, we get a value of only 0.01- pretty small in statistical terms. However, that alone is not enough to indicate whether the ad campaign was a success. The dataset didn’t include information on how many revenue the company receives per unit, the cost of the campaign, etc.- all vital information to know.</p>
                                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Additionally, we know that some users saw the advertisements more than others. It may be that seeing the ad once had relatively little effect, but seeing it multiple times can strongly predict whether someone purchases the item. Most users in the dataset saw relatively few ads, but some users saw up to 2000.</p>
